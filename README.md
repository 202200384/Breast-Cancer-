# 🧠 Task 2 - Data Analysis, Visualization & Classification (Arabian)

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- Machine Learning classification using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models

## 📌 Description
A complete pipeline for analyzing a structured dataset using Python libraries:
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data handling
- **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for visualization
- **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating ML models

## 📂 Contents
- Load and explore the dataset
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Clean and prepare data
- Apply classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Evaluate models with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

## ▶️ How to Run
You can open the notebook using:
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## 📈 Example Visuals
The notebook includes:
- Count plots
- KDE plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Decision boundaries
- Model evaluation graphs

## 📎 Requirements
```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
